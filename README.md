When the user clicks the button to start the quiz, a timer starts giving them one minute to answer ten questions. If they answer correctly, their score goes up by one point per question answered correctly. If they answer incorrectly, the time remaining on the clock decreases by 10 seconds. When the timer reaches zero or they have answered all questions (whichever happens first), they are presented wtih their score and a submission form to enter their initials and store their information for the next user. They can click the "high scores" button to view the stats of the last users.
